This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Uppgift

[ ] Write a javascript program that as input takes a JSON object. 
[ ] Returns it with all key/values switched and the (new) value reversed as a string.

{"person": "beans"}

should output

{"beans":"nosrep"}

Please be mindful of the nested nature and the different data types that 
JSON offers! I'll leave how input/output works up to you!
